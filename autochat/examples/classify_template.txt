Straightforward, it's about "Health".
> LABEL(ids="1", label="Health")

## assistant
title 2 could be about "Health" since playing 93h straight is known to have bad consequence on the health. 
However, since we can't be sure, we should classify it as a "Technology" articles since  world of warcraft is a computed game.
title 3 is also about "Technology" since it's about a new iPhone.
